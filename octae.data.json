Among the advantages of the ages 5-17 database is that it was updated by the Census Bureau in 1995 and relates to LEA (NCES type 1 and 2 districts) boundaries for the 1995-96 school year. By law, the Census Bureau will update these data every two years.  Data based on school district boundaries for 1999/2000 is due to be available as early as November 1999.  In addition, the 15-19 database will be updated using 1997/1998 data. It will be available for both parts of the formula in April 2001, and we will expect States to use it at that time as described in the law. This school district data can be found at the Census web site at:",
